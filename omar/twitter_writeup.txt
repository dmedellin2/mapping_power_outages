Our decision to user Twitter is based on its advantages regarding its audience and usage. While many social media platforms promote their “networks” and “friend circles”, Twitter’s primary audience has always been more global in nature. Twitter states on their guidelines that they offer Twitter in order “To give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without any barriers”.iAdditionally, Twitter has emerged as the de-facto outlet for customer service for many companies. The ability to facilitate customer-to-business interactions in real time is an invaluable tool to companies looking to identify and resolve problems quickly. In fact, many organizations have deployed teams dedicated towards supporting customers through Twitter.ii In order to scrape the largest number of tweets discussing power outages, we focused our efforts on five states: California, Texas, New York, Michigan and Ohio. These states led country in terms of power outages in 2017 according to Generac, the nation’s largest company in home backup generatorsiii. From each state we selected the three largest cities based on population. With a total of 15 cities, we ensured access to the largest possible Twitter userbase to conduct our analysis.The standard Twitter search API places restrictions on its usage, most notable being the inability to query for tweets beyond the last seven daysiv. Our solution was to use Twitterscraper, a Python package that bypassed this limitation. The package also allows for the scraping of tweets based on the specific geographic coordinates. Our selection of coordinates for each city was selected based on the ability provide the largest coverage of city limits.Our data collection focused on querying Twitter for the following keywords: “XXX” “XXX” “XXX” and “XXX”. We limited our tweets to the past four years and the Python package by default excluded any retweets. In total we collected XXX tweets between 01/01/2016 and 05/XX/2020. Every tweet in the dataset originated from one of the geographic radii set for the respective city. This provided us with an additional level of assurance that the tweet was an actual account of that Twitter user’s experience. i https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-services-and-corporate-affiliatesii https://www.wsj.com/articles/worst-job-in-america-responding-to-irate-tweets-from-new-york-city-subway-riders-1525790473iii https://www.generac.com/be-prepared/power-outages/top-5-states-where-power-outage-occuriv https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
